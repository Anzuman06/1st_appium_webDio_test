# 1st_appium_webDio_test
I’ve created this test script using Appium webdriver.io, which can automate the following on the Canary Cloud console webpage,

1. login and visit the Cloud Canary dashboard page.

2. Select any dedicated account from the accounts list.

3. And then go to the account’s devices page.

4. Choose the device that has been mentioned in the code and open the device’s form.

5. Clear the device’s new name and save it.
